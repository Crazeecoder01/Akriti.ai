## 🖼️ Intelligent Image Fetching

### Real Logos (Automatic!)

When you write a brand name in your sketch, the AI will automatically fetch real logos:

**Examples:**
- Write "Nike" → Gets Nike's actual logo from `logo.clearbit.com/nike.com`
- Write "Starbucks" → Gets Starbucks logo
- Write "Apple" → Gets Apple logo
- Write "Microsoft" → Gets Microsoft logo

**How it works:**
```
Text in sketch: "TechCorp"
AI fetches: https://logo.clearbit.com/techcorp.com
```

### Context-Aware Images

The AI fetches relevant images from Unsplash based on your content:

**Examples:**

| If you draw... | AI fetches... |

| Travel website | `https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/?travel,adventure` |
| Tech startup | `https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/?technology,startup` |
| Fashion store | `https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/?fashion,style` |
